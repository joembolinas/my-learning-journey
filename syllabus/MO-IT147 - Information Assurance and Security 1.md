| Information Assurance and Security 1 is a three-unit course that applies foundational cybersecurity concepts to practical risk assessment and solution design. Learners will assess potential risks, vulnerabilities, and threats in a project from a previous course and develop a Final Solution Design Document outlining security controls, architecture principles, and financial assessments such as Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Return on Investment (ROI). This document will serve as the foundation for building the actual solution in IAS 2. |
