| In Computer Programming 2, learners gain a more in-depth understanding of programming, testing, debugging, and project management concepts and methods covered in Computer Programming 1. Advanced programming techniques are also covered in this course, such as the use of advanced data types, collection frameworks, event-driven programming, and exception handling.Learners will also be introduced to the concept of Software Change Requests (SCR), which opens them to other concepts of software development and project management processes. Practice problems are assigned to help the learners hone their programming skills and prepare them for the course's expected outputs and milestones. |
