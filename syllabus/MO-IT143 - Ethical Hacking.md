| In this course, learners will participate in a Capture the Flag (CTF) game as part of a three-member team, solving various mini-cybersecurity challenges using Python to capture flags. Between weeks, they will also face major challenges that test their skills further. These major challenges are represented by the milestones below:* Milestone 1: The Cryptic Vault- crack a weak password hash.* Milestone 2: Trace the Code -simplify a messy script to recover a hidden flag.* Terminal Assessment: Bonus Round- resolve a mentor-given cybersecurity challenge. |

| Process/structure Adherence | The learner has a limited understanding of auditing processes and structure adherence. They frequently deviate from established procedures and protocols, resulting in incomplete or inconsistent audits. Continuous guidance is required to follow basic auditing processes. | The learner demonstrates a basic understanding of auditing processes and structure adherence. They occasionally follow established procedures and protocols but sometimes miss critical steps, leading to partially complete audits. Some supervision is needed to ensure adherence to auditing processes. | The learner shows a growing ability to adhere to auditing processes and structure. They usually follow established procedures and protocols correctly, resulting in generally complete and consistent audits.
