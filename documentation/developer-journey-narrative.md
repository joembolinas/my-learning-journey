- **Academic Analysis**: Studied successful student portfolio approaches on LinkedIn and GitHub
- **Competitor Research**: Analyzed existing academic management tools and their limitations

**Key Insights Discovered:**
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) was emerging as a game-changer for AI-assisted development
- GitHub Actions could automate 90% of repetitive academic tasks
- VS Code workspace configuration could create course-specific development environments
- Professional developers maintain persistent knowledge graphs for project continuity

### **Week -2: Conceptual Framework Development**

**Google Docs Prototype Phase:**
- Created initial concept document: "Academic Workspace Automation Strategy"
- Outlined 5-course integration approach (MO-IT103, IT143, IT147, IT148, IT151)
- Defined AI-first architecture principles
- Mapped automation opportunities and workflow bottlenecks

**Core Architecture Decisions Made:**
```
📁 Academic Ecosystem Architecture v1.0
