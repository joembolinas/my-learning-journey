## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Git Submodule Strategy**

```bash
# Repository Structure (When Deployed)
TERM3-SY-2024-25/                    # Public Repository
â”œâ”€â”€ learning-materials-private/      # Git Submodule (Private Repo)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MO-IT103/                   # Course-specific private materials
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MO-IT143/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MO-IT147/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ MO-IT148/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ MO-IT151/
â””â”€â”€ courses/
    â””â”€â”€ [Course-Name]/
        â””â”€â”€ learning-materials/      # Junction/Symlink to private repo
```

### **Access Control Matrix**

| Content Type | Visibility | Location | Access Method |
|--------------|------------|----------|---------------|
| Project Code | Public | `courses/*/projects/` | Direct GitHub |
| Portfolio Items | Public | `courses/*/portfolio-items/` | Direct GitHub |
| Course Notes | Public | `courses/*/notes/` | Direct GitHub |
| Assignments | Public | `courses/*/assignments/` | Direct GitHub |
| **Learning Materials** | **Private** | **`learning-materials-private/`** | **Submodule + Invitation** |
| **Study Guides** | **Private** | **`learning-materials-private/`** | **Submodule + Invitation** |
| **Textbook Content** | **Private** | **`learning-materials-private/`** | **Submodule + Invitation** |

### **Privacy Compliance Features**

- **Automatic Exclusion**: `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits
- **Clear Documentation**: Access instructions visible to collaborators  
- **Professional Approach**: Industry-standard Git submodule implementation
- **Granular Control**: Per-course access management capability
- **Audit Trail**: Git history maintains access and contribution records

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Readiness**

### **Ready for GitHub Repository Creation**

**Phase 1**: Public Repository Setup (15 minutes)
- Repository creation with enhanced `.gitignore`
- Course directory structure with learning materials placeholders
- Professional README and documentation

**Phase 2**: Private Repository Integration (15 minutes)  
- Create `TERM3-Learning-Materials-Private` repository
- Add as Git submodule to main repository
- Configure junction/symbolic links (Windows PowerShell as Administrator)

**Phase 3**: Content Population (Ongoing)
- Move existing learning materials to private repository
- Populate public directories with assignments and projects
- Configure collaborator access as needed

### **Automation Integration**

**GitHub Actions Support**:
- Privacy compliance workflow can scan and report on content types
- Automated backup includes both public and private content tracking
- Portfolio updates exclude private materials from public showcases
- Progress tracking respects privacy boundaries

**VS Code Integration**:
- Workspace configuration supports both repositories
- Tasks can operate on appropriate content types
- MCP Memory tracks relationships while respecting privacy
