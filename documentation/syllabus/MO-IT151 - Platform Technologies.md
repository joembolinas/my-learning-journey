* What We Need: Finer FinMark

  Problem Statement

  FinMark Corporation has recently gained several new customers, each with multiple users. While business growth has been steadily increasing, the software and infrastructure were originally designed to handle only small-scale orders. With more customers now actively placing orders online, the current system and infrastructure have become overwhelmed and can no longer keep up with the growing demand.

  The company aims to double its number of customers by the end of the year. However, with the current system limitations, it cannot support the projected number of users and orders. At present, the companyâ€™s online order placement system can handle up to 500 orders daily, but with increasing customer activity and the companyâ€™s growth targets, the demand is projected to rise to 3,000 orders per day.

  As a result of these limitations, customers have begun raising multiple support tickets due to frequent system crashes and issues with order processing and handling.

  To address this urgent situation, the Chief Technology Officer has proposed a project that builds a specialized team to take action. Project Finer FinMark is composed of the following specialists with specific roles:

  1. Software Developers must optimize the application to efficiently scale and handle a significantly larger number of users and daily transactions.
  2. Network & Cybersecurity Specialists must ensure that as the system scales, it remains secure and resilientâ€”effectively minimizing crashes, safeguarding data, and preventing breaches.
  3. Data Analysts need to study ordering patterns, identify peak times that coincide with downtimes or errors, and help manage inventory by providing accurate demand forecasts.
* Project Finer FinMark

  For the next 12 weeks, you are reporting to the The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) who hired you as a consultant for their latest and biggest project to date. Project Finer FinMark aims to enhance the company's services which requires a scalable, secure, and data-driven platform that can support its growing SME client base. Your team, composed of Software Developers, Network and Cybersecurity Specialists, and Data Analysts, must present the following:

  Milestone 1: Project Blueprint

1. Software Development: Complete architecture with security, scalability, and testing considerations.
2. Networking and Cybersecurity: Finalized network diagram with firewall, security, and performance-enhancing measures.
3. Data Analytics: Refined data pipeline with handling of scalability, data integrity, and privacy issues.

* Milestone 2: Refined Project Prototype

1. Software Development - a functional application prototype
2. Networking and Cybersecurity - a working network simulation
3. Data Analytics - a functional data pipeline and analysis

* Terminal Assessment: Project Final Pitch

1. Everyone presents the final and refined project pitch to the CTO.

* What We Need: Finer FinMark

  Problem Statement

  FinMark Corporation has recently gained several new customers, each with multiple users. While business growth has been steadily increasing, the software and infrastructure were originally designed to handle only small-scale orders. With more customers now actively placing orders online, the current system and infrastructure have become overwhelmed and can no longer keep up with the growing demand.

  The company aims to double its number of customers by the end of the year. However, with the current system limitations, it cannot support the projected number of users and orders. At present, the companyâ€™s online order placement system can handle up to 500 orders daily, but with increasing customer activity and the companyâ€™s growth targets, the demand is projected to rise to 3,000 orders per day.

  As a result of these limitations, customers have begun raising multiple support tickets due to frequent system crashes and issues with order processing and handling.

  To address this urgent situation, the Chief Technology Officer has proposed a project that builds a specialized team to take action. Project Finer FinMark is composed of the following specialists with specific roles:

  1. Software Developers must optimize the application to efficiently scale and handle a significantly larger number of users and daily transactions.
  2. Network & Cybersecurity Specialists must ensure that as the system scales, it remains secure and resilientâ€”effectively minimizing crashes, safeguarding data, and preventing breaches.
  3. Data Analysts need to study ordering patterns, identify peak times that coincide with downtimes or errors, and help manage inventory by providing accurate demand forecasts.

Project Finer FinMark aims to enhance the company's services which requires a scalable, secure, and data-driven platform that can support its growing SME client base. Your team, composed of Software Developers, Network and Cybersecurity Specialists, and Data Analysts, must present the following:

  Milestone 1: Project Blueprint

1. Software Development: Complete architecture with security, scalability, and testing considerations.
2. Networking and Cybersecurity: Finalized network diagram with firewall, security, and performance-enhancing measures.
3. Data Analytics: Refined data pipeline with handling of scalability, data integrity, and privacy issues.

* Milestone 2: Refined Project Prototype

2. Networking and Cybersecurity - a working network simulation
3. Data Analytics - a functional data pipeline and analysis
