## 🎯 **Best Practices for Collecting Feedback**

### **10. Make It Easy**

- Provide clear templates
- Ask specific questions
- Offer multiple ways to provide feedback
- Set reasonable deadlines

### **11. Be Specific**

Instead of "give me feedback," ask:

- "How did you find my code review process?"
- "What did you think about my GUI implementation?"
- "How was my communication during our pair programming sessions?"

### **12. Show Appreciation**

- Thank everyone who provides feedback
- Share how you'll use their input
- Offer reciprocal recommendations

Would you like me to help you set up any of these feedback collection systems for your MotorPH project?
